## Data Researchers
Mohammed R. Falih: 
Falih conducted this research as part of his MSc studies at the College of Engineering, University of Baghdad. His work focused on rehabilitation approaches for maxillofacial deformities and the prototyping of orbital prostheses, aiming to provide alternative solutions to invasive methods in biomedical engineering applications. He was also primarily responsible for preparing the manuscript.
Fanar M. Abed:
Abed supervised Falih's MSc research and played a key role in its development. She previously led research in photogrammetry and laser scanning at the College of Engineering, University of Baghdad, which forms the foundation of this study. Abed contributed significantly to the manuscript’s development, revision, and refinement.
