#### Description:
This line chart with labels and points represents the rankings of Ivy League women’s soccer teams from 2009 to 2024. Each colored line represents a team, with its placement on the y-axis indicating its rank for that year. The y-axis is reversed so that 1st place appears at the top, and 8th place at the bottom. A gap is left for 2020, when the season was disrupted.
#### Interest:
It clearly visualizes trends in team performance over time, showing how some teams improve while others struggle. The visual complexity of the crisscrossing lines makes it engaging while still being readable. I chose this visualization because it effectively communicates historical patterns in sports rankings, allowing for easy comparison between teams.
#### Marks & Channels:
Marks: 
- line (used to connect rankings for each team over time)
- circle (used at each rank to highlight positions)
- text (used to display ranking numbers directly on points)

Channels:
- x-axis → Year (ordinal scale)
- y-axis → Rank (quantitative scale, reversed so 1 is at the top)
- color → Team (nominal scale)
- text → Shows ranking values at each point
