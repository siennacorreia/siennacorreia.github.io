## Dataset Info:
1. I worked with the Student Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle, with data on "Daily Lifestyle and Academic Performance of Students."
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset 
2. Upon looking into the dataset, I am most interested in the stress level relatonship to GPA and study hours per day. My initial hopes in analyzing the dataset were to understand the effect that daily study hours and GPA had on stress levels among college students.

## Dataset Analysis:
     * Distributions of variables (center and variability, e.g. std.dev or IQR)
     * Relationships between variables
     * Visualizations of the dataset
     * Limitations of your analysis and the dataset

### Variables Examined
Stress_Level: Categorical variable with three levels â€” Low, Moderate, and High.
GPA: A continuous variable indicating academic performance.
Study_Hours_Per_Day: Continuous variable showing daily time spent on studying.

### Additional lifestyle variables include:
Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day
Sleep_Hours_Per_Day
Social_Hours_Per_Day
Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day
