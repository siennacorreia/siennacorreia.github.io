## Dataset Info:
1. I worked with the Student Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle, with data on "Daily Lifestyle and Academic Performance of Students."
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset 
2. Upon looking into the dataset, I am most interested in the stress level relatonship to GPA and study hours per day. My initial hopes in analyzing the dataset were to understand the effect that daily study hours and GPA had on stress levels among college students.

## Dataset Analysis:

     * Visualizations of the dataset
     * Limitations of your analysis and the dataset
