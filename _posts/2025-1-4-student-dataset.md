## Dataset Info:
1. I worked with the Student Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle, with data on "Daily Lifestyle and Academic Performance of Students."
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset 
2. Upon looking into the dataset, I am most interested in the stress level relatonship to GPA and study hours per day. My initial hopes in analyzing the dataset were to understand the effect that daily study hours and GPA had on stress levels among college students.

## Dataset Analysis:

### Variables Examined
Stress_Level: Categorical variable with three levels â€” Low, Moderate, and High.
GPA: Variable indicating academic performance.
Study_Hours_Per_Day: Variable showing daily time spent on studying.

### Additional lifestyle variables include:
Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day
Sleep_Hours_Per_Day
Social_Hours_Per_Day
Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day

### Distributions of variables 

> #### Mean and Median GPA by Stress Level:
>                    mean  median
>  Stress_Level                  
>  High          3.261973    3.27
>  Low           2.816869    2.82
>  Moderate      3.024837    3.02

> #### Mean and Median Study Hours by Stress Level:
>                    mean  median
>  Stress_Level                  
>  High          8.385034     8.7
>  Low           5.474411     5.5
>  Moderate      6.969585     7.0


### Relationships between variables
GPA vs Stress Level:
Positive relationship observed: Higher stress levels correlate with higher GPA. Students in the "High" stress group show improved academic performance, potentially due to increased motivation or effort.

Study Hours vs Stress Level:
Positive relationship: Students in the "High" stress group spend more time studying, suggesting a link between stress and effort.

### Limitations of your analysis and the dataset
Dataset Quality:
Potential selection bias: High achievers might be overrepresented, skewing the relationship between stress and GPA.
Missing variables: Factors like mental health or access to resources are unaccounted for.

Causation vs Correlation:
Observed relationships (e.g., stress correlating with GPA) may not imply causation. External factors like personal discipline or institutional expectations might drive these results.

Categorical Simplification:
Stress level categorization (Low, Moderate, High) may oversimplify nuanced stress experiences.

## Conclusions:
4. What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?
